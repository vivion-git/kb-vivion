in ubuntu 10.04:

basiclly all I did was to follow the instruction of the `pppoeconf` command

all it takes are the *userID* and *PassWord*
other things are all defauted.

	$pon dsl-provider

if things are not valid, try above command to restart the service.

I know *pppoe* is in use by checking the configrations in Windows.
