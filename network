in ubuntu 10.04:

basiclly all I did was to follow the instruction of the `pppoeconf` command

all it takes are the *userID* and *PassWord*
other things are all defauted.

	$pon dsl-provider

if things are not valid, try above command to restart the service.

I know *pppoe* is in use by checking the configrations in Windows.

 e.g vivion@redbird:~$ ping linuxcommand.org

	traceroute:display a listing of all the "hops "network traffic takes to get from the logal system to a specified host .

	vivion@redbird:~$ traceroute slashdot.org

	netstat:used to examine various network settings and statistics.

	vivion@redbird:~$ netstat -ie         to display the network interfaces in our system .
