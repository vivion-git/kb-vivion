## common workflow
1.	navigate to your working dir, e.g

	cd kb-vivion

2.	make some modification, e.g

	vim git #do some editing here

3.	check what you've changed

	git diff

4.	if you add a new file named `newFile`, you need to do this

	git add newFile

5.	otherwise you can use the below to commit directly

	git commit -a -m "commit msg"

6.	now it is done, you can use `tig`, or `gitk` to view your history
## commit: 

commit means you want to put things into git repo

	git commit -a -m "commit msg"	

## change editor

	git config --global core.editor vim

`git config`: try to change configuration,

if you use `--global`, it will change `~/.gitconfig`

otherwise, it will change `.git/config`

if you use `--global`, your change will affect all your git repos

otherwise, it only has effect on the repo within which you run `git config` command
