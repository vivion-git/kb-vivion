name of a file

so in computer science, a file is usually named with its path.

when you want to talk about a file, you should always give its path first, so
a full name of a file may show like this

FULLNAME:

/home/peter/dd

+++++++++++

and `basename` is command that gives you the BASENAME of the argument you
passs to it. e.g.

$ basename /home/peter/dd
dd

now we know the BASENAME of /home/peter/dd
is:
dd

that is right!

so a name is just a name, if we say dd has FULLNAME, 

FULLNAME=/PATH/TO/THE/FILE + BASENAME

BASENAME is nothing but the filename

while

FULLNAME is PATH+the filename

the command `basename` is not the same like "ls".

what `basename` does is to remove the PATH out of FULLNAME, thus only the
filename left as its output.

'ls' is just to show files in a given dir.
