standard input ,standard output and standar error.
we can use the operator ">>" and ">".using the ">>"operator will result in the
output bingappended to the file .and using the ">"operator will rewrite the
file.
usually ,we the shell refereces the stdin ,stdout and stderr internally as file descriptors zero ,one
and two .
$ls -l /bin/usr 2>ls-error.txt
this means redirect the stderr to the file ls-error.txt.
>ls-output.txt 2>&1
redirects standard error to the file ls-output.txt ,but if the order is
changed to 2>&1 >ls-output  ,standard error is directed to the screen.
we can also use the single notation &> to redirect both standard output and
standard error to the file ls-output.txt.
ls -l /bin/usr &> ls-output.txt
