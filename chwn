if there is another user that can't enter ,because maybe some config files
lost or you delete the useful files carelessly,so the user is not be used .
if you want to delete all the user' files ,first you should delete the
user,then if you can't delete the user's files when  you are deleting.the
reason is maybe there are some config files that hide in the direction.so
first you should find the config files ,jump to the direction ,and 
use the command "ls -d .*" to see whether there is any hiden config files ,if
there is,before you delete the files ,you must change the owner of the files,
using"sudo chown vivion: config filename",and then delete them,using "rm -rf 
filename",then delete the user's direction."sudo chown vivion: user's
direction;rm -rf direction"
until this time ,I know why I can't delete the user's direction .the problem 
is about the promission.
